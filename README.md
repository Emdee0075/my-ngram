# Welcome to My Ngram
The ngram project aims to create a program that will count the number of occurrences per character

## Task
The task is to create the program that eill count the number of occurrences per charactre within a given string.

## Description
In computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.

Google Inc. has used this technique to improve the completion of its Search Engine. The program was developed by Jon Orwant and Will Brockman and released in mid-December 2010.
